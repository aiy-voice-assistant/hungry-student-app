# Main aspect

To develop our assistan we cared about four main aspect of the life of students away from home (topic of the hackathon):
  1. Time: students spend a lot of time in the University, then they have very little time to perfrom home activities
  2. Health: a lot of students lead a sedentary life, moreover due to the booredom of cooking thay eat a lot of junk food
  3. Money: not only students but also all people want the best service at the best price
  4. Comodity: all the services just described offered for maximum comfort
  
After this kind of anlisys we start to develop the assistant.
